# Differential_SNP_Determination

In this repository we use Python and some of its libraries to determine which specifics SNPs appear in only one of all the vcf files analysed.
Also, in the process we can find all the SNPs (differential or not) that appear in the analysed samples.
To do so, we explain the process using a Jupyter notebook, being able to see how the tables are created and filled.
Note: The vcf files are not done by me, so the reference names and relevant information about the data has been removed.
